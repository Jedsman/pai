# AI/ML Integration Patterns

## Frontend ↔ Backend Integration

**Async UI Pattern**: Frontend makes non-blocking requests to AI endpoints, shows loading states, handles timeouts gracefully.

**Streaming Responses**: Use Server-Sent Events for real-time AI output (useful for long-running model inference).

**Graceful Degradation**: When AI services fail, frontend falls back to cached suggestions or simplified functionality.

**Progressive Enhancement**: Core task management works without AI; AI suggestions enhance the experience.

## Backend ↔ AI Service Integration

**Background Processing**: AI analysis happens asynchronously using task queues (Celery/RQ) to avoid blocking user requests.

**Circuit Breaker**: Automatically disable AI calls after repeated failures, return cached/mock responses, auto-recover after timeout.

**Retry with Backoff**: Handle transient AI service failures with exponential backoff and jitter.

**Model Versioning**: Support multiple model versions simultaneously, route requests based on user tier or experiment groups.

## Data Pipeline Integration

**Event-Driven Architecture**: Task creation triggers AI analysis events, user feedback triggers model retraining pipelines.

**Data Validation**: Pydantic schemas ensure data consistency between components and validate training data quality.

**ETL Pipelines**: Extract user interactions, transform for model training, load to ML platforms (Vertex AI/MLflow).

**Feature Stores**: Centralized feature management for consistent data between training and inference.

## Compute Infrastructure Integration

**Auto-scaling**: Scale inference pods based on queue length, GPU utilization, and request latency metrics.

**Resource Isolation**: Separate compute pools for different model types, use node affinity for GPU workloads.

**Blue-Green Deployments**: Deploy new models alongside existing ones, gradually shift traffic, rollback if needed.

**Resource Quotas**: Prevent runaway AI workloads from consuming all cluster resources.

## Cross-Component Patterns

**Unified Error Handling**: Consistent error codes and messages across all components, structured logging with correlation IDs.

**Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings for model endpoints, API keys, resource limits.

**Health Checks**: Multi-level health checks (API health, model availability, GPU status) for proper load balancing.

**Observability**: Distributed tracing across frontend→backend→AI service calls, custom metrics for AI-specific SLIs.
